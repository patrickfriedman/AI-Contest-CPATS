# Example usage:
scores = [80, 90, 95, 87, 92]
print(grade_system(scores))","To create a grading system, we can define a function that takes a list of student scores as input. We can then calculate the average score, highest score, and lowest score using built-in functions such as sum(), max(), and min(). Finally, we can return these values along with the original list of scores as a JSON string using the json module."
