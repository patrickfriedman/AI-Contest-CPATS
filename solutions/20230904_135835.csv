# Test the function
print(get_grade(85))  # Output: B

print(get_grade(95))  # Output: A","To create a grading system, we can use the if-elif-else statements to assign grades based on certain conditions. We can define a function that takes a score as input and returns the corresponding grade. The function can include multiple if-elif-else statements to check different score ranges and assign grades accordingly. Finally, we can call the function with different scores to test its functionality."
