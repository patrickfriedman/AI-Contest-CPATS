print(fibonacci_sequence(n))","To calculate the Fibonacci numbers up to a given number, we can use a loop to generate each number in the sequence. We start with the first two numbers, 0 and 1, and then generate the subsequent numbers by summing the previous two. We continue this process until we reach the given number. The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of dynamic programming and can be solved iteratively."
