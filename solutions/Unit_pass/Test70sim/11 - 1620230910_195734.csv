            east_cars += 1
        else:
            passing_cars += east_cars
    return passing_cars","To count the number of passing cars, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the number of cars traveling east. For each car traveling west, we add the number of cars traveling east to the count of passing cars. Finally, we return the count of passing cars."
