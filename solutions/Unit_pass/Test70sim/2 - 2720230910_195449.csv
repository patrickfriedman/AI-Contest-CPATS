    n = len(cards)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = cards[i]

    for i in range(n - 1):
        dp[i][i + 1] = max(cards[i], cards[i + 1])

    for length in range(3, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            dp[i][j] = max(cards[i] + min(dp[i + 2][j], dp[i + 1][j - 1]), cards[j] + min(dp[i + 1][j - 1], dp[i][j - 2]))

    return dp[0][n - 1]","To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D array dp to store the maximum total value we can win for each subarray. dp[i][j] represents the maximum total value we can win for the subarray from index i to index j. We can calculate the values of dp[i][j] using the following formula: dp[i][j] = max(cards[i] + min(dp[i+2][j], dp[i+1][j-1]), cards[j] + min(dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i][j-2]))

We start with the base cases where i = j and i = j - 1. For i = j, dp[i][j] is simply the value of cards[i]. For i = j - 1, dp[i][j] is the maximum of cards[i] and cards[j]. We then iterate over the subarray lengths from 3 to n, and for each length, we iterate over all possible starting indices. We fill in the dp table using the formula mentioned earlier. Finally, the maximum total value we can win is stored in dp[0][n-1]."
