    breeds = breed.split()
    breed_count = {}
    total_delegations = 0

    # Count the number of each breed
    for b in breeds:
        breed_count[b] = breed_count.get(b, 0) + 1

    # Calculate the number of possible delegations
    for i in range(n):
        count_i = breed_count[breeds[i]]
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            count_j = breed_count[breeds[j]]
            total_delegations += count_i * count_j

    return total_delegations","To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of cow breeds and keep track of the count of each breed using a dictionary. Then, for each index in the list, we can calculate the number of possible delegations by multiplying the count of the breed at that index with the count of all other breeds. Finally, we can sum up the number of possible delegations for each index and return the total count."
