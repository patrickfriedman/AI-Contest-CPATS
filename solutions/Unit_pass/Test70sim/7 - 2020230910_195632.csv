    for team in teams:

    groups.sort(reverse=True)
    return groups","To solve this problem, we need to divide the teams into groups as evenly as possible. We can start by calculating the total number of people in all teams. Then, we can calculate the target number of people in each group by dividing the total number of people by the number of groups. We can initialize an empty list to store the number of people in each group. Next, we can iterate through the teams and distribute the people into groups. If there are any remaining people after distributing them evenly, we can assign them to the groups with the fewest people. Finally, we can sort the list of people in each group in descending order and return it as the output."
