    fractions.sort()
    return fractions","To solve this problem, we can iterate over all possible numerators from 0 to N and all possible denominators from 1 to N. For each numerator and denominator pair, we can check if they are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1). If they are coprime, we add the fraction to the result list. Finally, we sort the result list in ascending order and return it."
