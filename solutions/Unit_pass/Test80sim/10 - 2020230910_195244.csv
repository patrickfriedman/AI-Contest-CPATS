        return 0","To determine whether a string is properly nested, we can use a stack data structure. We iterate through each character in the string. If we encounter an opening parenthesis, we push it onto the stack. If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the closing parenthesis. If either of these conditions is true, we return 0. After iterating through all the characters, if the stack is empty, we return 1; otherwise, we return 0."
