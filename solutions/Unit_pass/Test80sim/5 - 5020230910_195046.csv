We can start by splitting the equation into three parts: left side, right side, and the equal sign. Then, we can count the number of atoms in each molecule and multiply it by the quantity of the molecule. Finally, we compare the total count of atoms on the left side with the total count on the right side. If they are equal, the equation is balanced."
