    return ''.join(stack[::-1])","To remove duplicate letters and ensure lexicographic order, we can use a stack to keep track of the unique letters in the string. We iterate through the string and for each character, we check if it is already in the stack. If it is not, we push it onto the stack. Finally, we join the characters in the stack together to form the resulting string. Since a stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) order, the characters will be in the reverse order of their appearance in the original string. To get the lexicographically smallest string, we can reverse the stack before joining the characters."
