    fractions.sort()
    return fractions","To solve this problem, we can iterate through each possible numerator and denominator and check if the fraction is irreducible. We can use the math.gcd() function to find the greatest common divisor between the numerator and denominator. If the gcd is 1, then the fraction is irreducible and we can add it to the result list. Finally, we sort the result list in ascending order and return it as the output."
