    count_east = 0

    for car in a:
        if car == 0:
            count_east += 1
        else:
            count_passing += count_east
    return count_passing","To count the number of passing cars, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the number of cars traveling east. For each car traveling west, we can add the number of cars traveling east to the count. This way, we can count all the passing cars in a single pass through the array."
