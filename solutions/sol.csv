    return dp[0][n-1]","To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D table to store the maximum total value we can win for each subarray of cards. We start with subarrays of length 1 and gradually build up to the whole array. For each subarray, we consider two possibilities: either choose the first card or choose the last card. We update the table with the maximum value we can obtain by choosing the best option. Finally, the maximum total value we can win for the whole array is stored in the top-right cell of the table."
