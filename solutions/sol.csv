def solution(source_url):
    parsed_url = urllib.parse.urlparse(source_url)
    scheme = parsed_url.scheme
    if not scheme:
        scheme = 'http'
    host = parsed_url.hostname
    port = parsed_url.port
    if not port:
        if scheme == 'http':
            port = 80
        elif scheme == 'https':
            port = 443
    path = parsed_url.path
    query = parsed_url.query
    return [host, str(port), path]
","To solve this problem, we can use the urlparse library in Python to parse the given URL and extract its components. We can then check if the scheme is provided and assign the default port accordingly. Finally, we return the host, port, path, and query parts as an array. The solution code will be simple and efficient, using only built-in Python libraries."
