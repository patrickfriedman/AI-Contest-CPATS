    n = len(cards)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        dp[i][i] = cards[i]
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            dp[i][j] = max(cards[i] + min(dp[i+2][j], dp[i+1][j-1]), cards[j] + min(dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i][j-2]))

    return dp[0][n-1]","To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array dp with dimensions n x n, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum total value we can win considering only the cards from index i to index j. The base case is when i = j, in which case dp[i][j] = cards[i]. For other cases, we have two options: either we choose the card at index i or the card at index j. If we choose the card at index i, our opponent will choose the best option from dp[i+1][j]. If we choose the card at index j, our opponent will choose the best option from dp[i][j-1]. We want to maximize our total value, so we choose the option that gives us the maximum total value. We can fill the dp array using a bottom-up approach, starting from smaller subproblems and gradually building up to the final solution. Finally, the maximum total value we can win will be stored in dp[0][n-1]."
